ChessBoardRiddle
================

Code to solve the Chess Board riddle by using Mathematica to set up a system of equations.

On an 8 x 8 chessboard, define two squares to be neighbors if they share a common side. Some squares will have two neighbors, some will have three, and some will have four. Now suppose each square contains a number subject to the following condition: The number in a square equals the average of the numbers of all its neighbors. If the square with coordinates [1, 1] (i.e. a corner square) contains the number 10, then find (with proof) all possible values that the square with coordinates [8, 8] (i.e. opposite corner) can have?
